Advantages of Cloud Computing

* Go global in minutes
* Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
* Benefit from massive economies of scale
* Increase speed and agilty
* Stop guessing capacity
* Trade capital expense for variable expense

Benefits

* High availability - Highly available systems are designed to operate continuously without failure for a long time. These systems avoid loss of service by reducing or managing failures.
* Elasticity - With elasticity, you don't have to plan ahead of time how much capacity you need. You can provision only what you need, and then grow and shrink based on demand
* Agility - The cloud gives you increased agility. All the services you have access to help you innovate faster, giving you speed to market. 
* Durability - Durability is all about long-term data protection. This means your data will remain intact without corruption.

CapEx - upfront purchases toward fixed assets
OpEx - funds used to run day to day operations

Capacity is matched to demand.
